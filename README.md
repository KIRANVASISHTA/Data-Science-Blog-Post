* **AirBnBBoston.ipynb**: jupyter notebook with the code
* **AirBnBBoston.html**: html file of the jupyter notebook.
* **calendar.csv, listings.csv, reviews.csv**: Data files.

## Summary of Results:
Through the process of Crisp-DM following results were obtained.
* September and to a lesser entent October is the busiest period to visit the Boston. So the best time to visit Boston in terms of the price of rooms is fom November to February.
